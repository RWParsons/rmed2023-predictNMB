## Example problem and inputs required - inpatient falls

- Falls leads to about 0.04 lost Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)
  (Latimer et al. 2013) and has an approximate beta distribution of:
  $$\mathrm{B}(\alpha = 2.95, \beta = 32.25)$$  

- There are also additional healthcare costs of about \$6669 (Morello et
  al. 2015) and follows an approximate gamma distribution of:
  $$\Gamma (\alpha = 22.05, \beta = 0.0033) $$

- Fall prevention education…

  - has a fixed, known cost of \$77.3 per patient (Hill et al. 2015)
  - reduces probability of fall by 45% (Haines et al. 2011) - the log
    hazard ratio follows an approximate normal distribution of:
    $$\mathcal{N}(\mu = -0.844, \sigma = 0.304) $$

- The willingness-to-pay (WTP) for us is \$28033 AUD

- Current practice: Everyone gets the fall prevention intervention
  (treat-all approach).

Calculations and code for using details in paper cited papers above is
described in (Parsons et al. 2023).

## Objectives/Questions

- We have a prediction model which has an AUC of about 0.8 and we want
  to know whether it’ll be worthwhile implementing it within a CDSS to
  reduce healthcare costs (giving people that are unlikely to fall the
  intervention at \$77.3 a pop!)

- We are currently in a geriatric ward where the fall rate is about 0.1
  (1 in 10 admitted patients have a fall) but are also interested in
  implementing the same model in the acute care ward (fall rate = 0.03).
  Would we expect to make the same conclusion?

- We think we can improve the performance of the model up to 0.95 with
  some extra effort by the models - would this change our conclusion?

## pre-`{predictNMB}` primer on the distributions we will be using.

We will be using different distributions to sample different inputs for
our simulation. A gamma distribution is often appropriate when sampling
\$ and a beta distribution is often best when sampling QALYs due to the
shape and limits being sensible (the cost of treatment is unlikely be to
be negative and QALYs are bounded to be between 0 and 1, similar to a
probability of an event). We can sample from these distributions using R
code with the `rgamma()` and `rbeta()` functions - for example, here are
the distributions above for the healthcare costs and the QALYs
associated with a fall:

``` r
data.frame(QALYs_lost = rbeta(10000, shape1 = 2.95, shape2 = 32.25)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = QALYs_lost)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

``` r
data.frame(fall_costs = rgamma(10000, shape = 22.05, rate = 0.0033)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = fall_costs)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

We will be using these sampling functions within our NMB sampling
functions!

## `{predictNMB}`

## Making our samplers

``` r
validation_sampler <- get_nmb_sampler()

training_sampler <- get_nmb_sampler()
```

## Primary analyses

### Running our simulation (primary use-case)

``` r
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)

primary_sim <- do_nmb_sim()
```

### Interpreting our results

``` r
summary(primary_sim)

autoplot(primary_sim) + theme_sim()

ce_plot(primary_sim)
```

## Acute care setting?

``` r
acute_care_sim <- do_nmb_sim()

summary(acute_care_sim)
autoplot(acute_care_sim)
ce_plot(acute_care_sim)
```

## What if we improve the model discrimination (AUC)?

``` r
auc_screen <- screen_simulation_inputs()
```
